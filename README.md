# SQL Data Analysis Project
## Overview
In this project, SQL data analysis was performed to extract and analyze specific information about employees and departments within a company. The tasks involved listing various details about employees, their hire dates, department managers, and the distribution of employees across different departments. Additionally, the project included generating frequency counts of employee last names. The analysis utilized six CSV files containing the necessary data and involved both data engineering and data analysis processes.

## Data Analysis Tasks
Employee Details:

The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee were retrieved to provide a comprehensive overview of the workforce.
Employees Hired in 1986:

The first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986 were listed to understand the hiring patterns and seniority within the company.
Department Managers:

The manager of each department was identified along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name to map out the leadership structure within the company.
Employee Department Details:

The department number for each employee was listed along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name to analyze how employees are distributed across different departments.
Specific Employee Search:

The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B were found to demonstrate targeted querying capabilities.
Sales Department Employees:

Each employee in the Sales department was listed, including their employee number, last name, and first name, to understand the composition of the Sales team.
Sales and Development Department Employees:

Each employee in the Sales and Development departments was listed, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name, to compare the staffing of these key departments.
Employee Last Name Frequency:

Frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names were generated to determine how many employees share each last name, which helps in identifying common surnames within the organization.
## Data Engineering and Analysis
The project involved extensive data engineering to ensure that the six CSV files were properly structured and managed. This included defining all required columns for each table, setting correct data types, establishing primary and foreign keys, and applying necessary constraints such as NOT NULL conditions. Accurate value lengths were defined for each column to maintain data integrity.

Once the data engineering tasks were completed, data analysis was performed using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. This dual approach of data engineering and data analysis ensured that the data was both reliable and insightful, allowing for comprehensive analysis and reporting.
